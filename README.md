# C-Programming-Language-2nd-Edition - Exercises and Notes

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises and my notes from the book "The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.

The purpose of this repository is to track my progress as I learn the C programming language using this classic book. Each chapter of the book has its own directory, which includes:

- Solutions to the exercises in the chapter, named in the format `[exercise_number].c`, e.g., `1_1.c`, `1_2.c`, etc.
- Notes and thoughts on the content of the chapter, in the `[section_name].md` file, e.g., `Section1.md`, `Section2.md`, etc.

Feel free to browse the code and notes, and to use them as a reference for your own learning. However, I strongly recommend trying to solve the exercises on your own before looking at the solutions.

Note: The solutions provided here are based on my personal understanding and may not be the most optimal or only way to solve the problems.

Happy coding!
