### EOF in Program Execution

In actual program execution, EOF is not just a single character at the end of the input stream but a continuous state indicating the end of a file or input stream. Once the end of the input stream is reached, every subsequent read operation will return EOF until the program logic stops reading or the file is closed.

### EOF as a Status Flag, Not a Character:

- **EOF is a special constant**: It is typically defined as `-1` and is used to indicate that the input stream has ended. It is not an actual data character in the input stream but an internal signal used by the program to indicate that there is no more data to read.

- **EOF is a persistent state**: Once you reach the end of the input stream or file, every subsequent read operation (such as `getch()`, `fgetc()`, or `scanf()`) will return EOF, indicating that the input stream is complete. This behavior persists until the program stops reading or the file is closed.

### Behavior When Reading EOF:

- When a program reads from a file or input stream and reaches the end, reading functions (like `getch()`, `fgetc()`, or `scanf()`) will return EOF to signal that there is no more data to read.
  
- Once EOF is encountered, unless the stream is reset (for example, by calling `rewind()` or reopening the file), every call to a read function will continue to return EOF.
