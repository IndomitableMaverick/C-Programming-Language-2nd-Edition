## Our `getch` and `ungetch` do not handle a pushed-back `EOF` correctly. Decide what their properties ought to be if an `EOF` is pushed back, then implement your design.

I think that `EOF` should not be pushed back. `EOF` is a special marker indicating the end of input or an error, and it is not a regular character. Allowing `EOF` to be pushed back could lead to confusion or ambiguous behavior in reading operations.  Therefore, `ungetch` should reject any attempt to push back `EOF` and handle it as an error or simply ignore the request.
