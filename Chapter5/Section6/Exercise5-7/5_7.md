The time difference is minimal because the original alloc also uses a preallocated array (allocbuf), but it adds an extra layer of function calls. The only real overhead comes from calling alloc and managing the pointer, which is relatively small compared to directly using the array supplied by main. Both approaches avoid dynamic memory allocation, so the performance is quite similar.
