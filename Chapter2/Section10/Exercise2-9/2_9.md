When subtract 1 from `x`, you flip all the bits from the rightmost 1-bit onwards:
- The rightmost 1-bit becomes `0`.
- All the `0` bits after the rightmost 1-bit become `1`.
- The bits to the left of the rightmost 1-bit remain unchanged.

So, if `x` had a structure like this:
```
x = ...1000
```
Then `x - 1` would look like this:
```
x - 1 = ...0111
```

Now, if you perform the bitwise AND of `x` and `x - 1`, the bits **to the left of the rightmost 1-bit** remain unchanged because those bits are identical in both `x` and `x - 1`. However, at the position of the rightmost 1-bit and to the right of it, the result will be **0** because:
- The rightmost 1-bit in `x` has been flipped to `0` in `x - 1`.
- All bits after the rightmost 1-bit in `x` are `0`, and in `x - 1` they are `1`. The bitwise AND of `0 & 1` results in `0`.
