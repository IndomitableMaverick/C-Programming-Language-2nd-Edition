## Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every `n` columns. Should `n` be a `variable` or a `symbolic parameter`?
From my point of view, `n` should be a `symbolic parameter` because the positions of tab stops are relatively fixed and, once determined, they typically do not change. This makes it more suitable to be defined as a constant rather than a variable. Using a symbolic constant improves code readability and maintainability, as it clearly indicates that the value is not meant to be altered throughout the program. Defining `n` as a constant also avoids unnecessary reassignments and ensures the tab stop spacing remains consistent.
