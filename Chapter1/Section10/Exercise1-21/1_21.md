## When either a tab or a single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should be given preference?
When either a tab or a single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, **a tab should be given preference**. There are several reasons for this:

1. **Efficiency**: A tab represents a single character, whereas a blank space is also a single character, but a tab can cover multiple columns depending on the tab stop configuration. Using a tab is often more efficient in terms of storage and transmission, as it can compress what would otherwise be multiple spaces into one character.

2. **Consistency**: Tabs are designed specifically to move the cursor to the next tab stop, ensuring consistent alignment across different editors and environments that respect tab stops. Blanks, on the other hand, can lead to alignment issues if the tab stop positions or display settings vary between systems or editors.

3. **Readability**: When viewing or editing the file in environments that display characters differently, tabs can more clearly indicate alignment, while spaces may not be as obvious. Tabs are often preferred in code and text formatting to ensure columns are aligned properly.

4. **Convention**: In many programming style guides and text formatting systems, tabs are preferred for indentation and alignment, as they are specifically designed to handle spacing in a structured way.

In summary, using a tab when it can substitute for a single blank is generally preferable for reasons of efficiency, consistency, and clarity.
