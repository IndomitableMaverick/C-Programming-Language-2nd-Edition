### Phenomenon:
1. When enter `hello` followed by **`Ctrl+Z`**, the program does not terminate immediately. The terminal processes the hello string, and Ctrl+Z is treated as a regular character, so the program continues waiting for more input.
2. When enter **`Ctrl+Z`** alone and press Enter, the program detects EOF and exits the input loop, terminating as expected.

### Reason Analysis:
On Windows, **`Ctrl+Z`** is used as an EOF signal, but it must be entered **alone** and followed by **Enter** to be recognized as EOF. This behavior is related to how the terminal handles input buffering.

### How Input Buffering Works:
The `getchar()` function reads characters from the **standard input buffer**, which is **line-buffered**. This means the input is only sent to the program after you press **Enter**. When you type `hello` and then press `Ctrl+Z`, the terminal only sends the string `hello` to the buffer, and **`Ctrl+Z`** is treated as a regular character, not as the EOF signal.

### Why Does `Ctrl+Z` Alone Trigger EOF?
When you input `Ctrl+Z` alone and press **Enter**, the terminal sends `Ctrl+Z` as the **EOF signal** to the program. EOF is a special signal, not a character, indicating the end of input, which causes the program to detect EOF and exit the loop.

### Why Does `helloCtrl+Z` Not Work?
When you type `helloCtrl+Z` and press **Enter**, the terminal processes the `hello` characters first and doesn't send EOF until `Enter` is pressed. `Ctrl+Z` mixed with other characters is treated as regular input, not EOF, so the program continues reading.

### How to Terminate Input Correctly:
To trigger EOF and end input, **`Ctrl+Z` must be entered alone**, followed by **Enter**:
1. Enter `hello` and press **Enter**.
2. Then press `Ctrl+Z` and **Enter** again. This sends the EOF signal to the program.
