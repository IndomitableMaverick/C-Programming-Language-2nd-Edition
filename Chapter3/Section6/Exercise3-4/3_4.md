In **two's complement** representation, negation is performed by **inverting all the bits (bitwise NOT) and then adding 1**. For most numbers, this works perfectly to compute the negative value. However, for the **smallest negative number**, such as `-2^31` in a 32-bit system, this operation doesn't work as expected.

Here's why:

- In a 32-bit two's complement system, the smallest negative number is `-2^31` (which is `1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000` in binary).
- When you try to negate this value, the following happens:
  1. **Bitwise NOT** (`~`): Inverting all the bits of `-2^31` gives `0111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111` (which is `2^31 - 1` in binary).
  2. **Add 1**: Adding 1 to this gives `1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000` again, which is **still `-2^31`**.

Therefore, for the smallest negative number, the operation **"negate"** doesn't change the value, leading to the issue in the `itoa` function where it cannot properly handle the conversion of `-2^31`.
